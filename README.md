# Python Programming Basics and Decorator Implementation
This repository contains my work for **Assignment 1: Python Refresher**. 
My assignment contains two parts:
1) Python programming basics (echo function)
2) Python decorator implementation (Fibonacci recursive function, with caching and a timer)</br>
Python files, along with screenshots of code and outputs are included below with documentation.</br>


## Repository Structure
- `echo.py` - Python script containing an echo function
- `fib.py` - Python script containing a Fibonacci recursive function that caches calculated Fibonacci numbers and calculates runtime in seconds. This script also outputs a plot of Fibonacci numbers over runtime.
- `fib_plot.png` - Photo of the output plot from `fib.py`
- `code_images/`
  - `echo_code.png`
  - `fib_code.png` 
- `output_images/`
  - `echo_output.png`
  - `fib_output.png`
- `README.md` - Assignment documentation


##  Part 1: Python Programming Basics (echo function)

The Python file `echo.py` imitates a real-world echo using the function echo(), which contains two input parameters: `text`, a string that represents what the user yells at a mountain, and `repetitions`, an integer that represents the number of times the mountain echoes the user's voice, with the default value being 3. `echo()` then returns a string which represents the echoed sound with a fading effect and ending the echo with a period.</br></br>
