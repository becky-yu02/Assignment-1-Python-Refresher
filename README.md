# Python Programming Basics and Decorator Implementation
This repository contains my work for **Assignment 1: Python Refresher**. 
My assignment contains two parts:
1) Python programming basics (echo function)
2) Python decorator implementation (Fibonacci recursive function, with caching and a timer)</br>
Python files, along with screenshots of code and outputs are included below with documentation.</br>


## Repository Structure
- `echo.py` - Python script containing an echo function
- `fib.py` - Python script containing a Fibonacci recursive function that caches calculated Fibonacci numbers and calculates runtime in seconds. This script also outputs a plot of Fibonacci numbers over runtime.
- `fib_plot.png` - Photo of the output plot from `fib.py`
- `code_images/`
  - `echo_code.png`
  - `fib_code.png` 
- `output_images/`
  - `echo_output.png`
  - `fib_output.png`
- `README.md` - Assignment documentation


## Part 1: Python Programming Basics (echo function)
The Python file `echo.py` imitates a real-world echo using the function echo(), which contains two input parameters: `text`, a string that represents what the user yells at a mountain, and `repetitions`, an integer that represents the number of times the mountain echoes the user's voice, with the default value being 3. An image of the code is shown below, and is included in the `code_images/` folder.</br></br>

`echo()` then returns a string which represents the echoed sound with a fading effect and ending the echo with a period.</br>
Output examples are shown below, and are included in the `output_images/` folder.</br></br>
